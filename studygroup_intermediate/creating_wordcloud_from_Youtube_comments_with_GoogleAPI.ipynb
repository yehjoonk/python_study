Gas is used that can be compressed with the pump and thus the temperature would rise. The compressed side is the hot side. The hot side is used to blow hot air in the car and by doing so, cooling the hot side of the heat pump system. Then the gas is let to expand on the cold side. The expanded gas has very low temperature because heat was already taken from it when it was compressed to heat the car.

This is the concept that work can be extracted from a process of heat transfer from a hot source and a cold source. For a refrigeration system, this is a reverse Carnot cycle system which consists of 4 components and a working fluid. The working fluid in both refrigeration and heat pump cycles is known as a refrigerant (e.g. r-134a, r-1234yf, etc). These fluids are used due to their low boiling point.\\n\\nComponents:\\n1. Compressor\\n2. Condensor\\n3. Throttle Expansion Valve\\n4. Evaporator\\n\\nRefrigeration Cycle (See link):\\n\\n1-2: The working fluid (refrigerant) is compressed from a vapour into the superheated vapour region, increasing the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant far beyond the surrounding temperature. Work is input into the system through the pump.\\n2-3: The superheated vapour then travels through a condenser which rejects heat into the environment, condensing the superheated vapour into a liquid state. In a refrigerator, this is the element which is located behind the fridge.\\n3-4: The liquid then enters the throttle valve which causes a large drop in pressure, rapidly decreasing the temperature of the working fluid and also causes the working fluid to become a saturated liquid-vapour mixture.\\n4-1: The cooled refrigerant can now flow through an evaporator which absorbs the heat from the refrigerated space, returning the working fluid to a vapour phase. This is located inside the fridge system and is what reduces the temperature inside the fridge.\\n\\nHeat Pump Cycle:\\n\\nThis is literally the reverse. You use the condenser to heat up the air, which you can now circulate inside the car. This will use less energy than an electric element due to the lower power input of a pump, which is the only energy input to the system required.\\n\\nRefrigeration Cycle:\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump#/media/File:Refrigeration_PV_diagram.svg', 'Squatting position seats is a deal breaker for me', \"Just stick with the GR-Y, at least it'll be worth something in 10yrs time.\", '14.04-14.06 - Мэт не выглядит здоровым.\\nДайте русскую озвучку!

The heat that was transferred to the fluid when it boiled is now transferred inside the car.  So what the heat pump is doing is cooling the air outside the car to heat up the air inside the car. \\n\\nThe reason this is more efficient that using a resistive heater is because all the heat that warms the cabin has to come from the electricity to heat the resistive coil.  A heat pump gets most of it\\'s heat from the air outside the car that it\\'s cooling off.  the energy drain on the battery is actually just the Mechanical energy used to compress the and move the fluid around.

Part of that, called an evaporator, has a very low pressure, which means that the HFC will boil and become a gas at very low temperatures. In this stage, the HFC absorbs heat. \\n\\nThen, the HFC passes a compressor. This increases the pressure, which both increases the temperature of the HFC, and turns it back into a fluid. \\n\\nNow, the hot HFC passes into a part called the condenser, where it drains its heat into the environment. \\n\\nFinally, the now chilled HFC passes into an expansion valve, where it drops in temperature and returns to a gaseous for due to lower pressure. Then the cycle repeats. \\n\\nDepending on what you want to do, you place the evaporator and the condenser on different parts of your system.
